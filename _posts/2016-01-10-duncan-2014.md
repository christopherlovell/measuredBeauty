This paper studies the growth in mass of stars in galaxies in the early universe. They measure the masses of galaxies in the redshift range 4 to 7, which corresponds with 1.5 to 0.7 billion years after the big bang. The authors estimate the mass using our current understanding of how the light from stars in galaxies at such early times should look, taking in to account the effect of gas in those galaxies. They also estimate the star formation rate of the galaxies by calculating the amount of ultraviolet radiation they emit, correcting for the effect of dust in the environment, which is important in the early universe as dust was more prevalent. This ultraviolet magnitude can be used to estimate the intrinsic star formation rate of the galaxies.

The plot shows the star formation rate density against redshift. The black points, filled and empty, show the results from this work using two different fitting functions. The grey points show recent observations, alongside an empirical fit shown as a dashed black line. Dust-corrected estimates from a number of surveys at higher redshift are given as coloured points.
