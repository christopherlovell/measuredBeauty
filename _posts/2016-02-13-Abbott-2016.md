Over a billion years ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a pair of black holes collided. Each one had the mass of 300 suns, and the collision released 3 solar masses of this as pure energy, all in a fraction of a second. This huge amount of energy created ripples in the very fabric of space time, ripples that propagated outwards through the universe. In September 2015, these ripples passed right through the Earth. Two detectors in the US, designed specifically to observe such signals, were listening, and captured the first ever detection of gravitational waves. Poetically, the detection was made just over 100 years after Einstein predicted their existence as a result of his theory of general relativity.

The plot shows the observed signal at both detectors. The shape of the signal is characteristic of a black hole merger. The fact that the same signal was seen at both detectors almost simultaneously gave the experimenters the confidence to declare the discovery.
