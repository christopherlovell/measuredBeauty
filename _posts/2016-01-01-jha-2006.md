This paper looks at applying a new method to estimate the distances to Type Ia supernovae. Type Ia supernovae occur in binary systems of two stars, where one of the stars is a white dwarf. If the white dwarf starts to accrete material from the second star it can grow until it approaches a critical mass, known as the Chandrasekhar limit. When the mass gets very close to this limit the white dwarf cannot support itself (the exact mechanism by which it reaches instability is still being debated), and explodes as a supernovae. Because the break down occurs at the exact same mass in all of these systems, the energy released is almost identical, making these supernovae ideal 'standard candles'; if you know how bright it should be, you can use the observed brightness to predict how far away the system is.

The plot shows the estimated errors in the parameters of the fit. Such fits are important for classifying and predicting the distance of newly discovered supernovae.
