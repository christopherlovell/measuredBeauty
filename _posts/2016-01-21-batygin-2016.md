This paper uses the orbital trajectories of objects in the Kuiper belt, a distant ring of objects beyond the orbit of Pluto, to infer the existence of a planet in the outer reaches of the solar system. Such a planet has been proposed previously, but this work provides the most compelling evidence yet. Confirmation through direct observation will be required to validate the claim.

The plot shows the location of all minor bodies in the outer solar system with a perihelion distance greater than 30 astronomical units, and an aphelion distance greater than 50 astronomical units. The lines on each point indicate the project of the orbit poles. The red points show those objects with an aphelion orbital distance greater than 250 astronomical units; the clustering of the orbits at this distance is peculiar, and used to infer the presence of another planet.
