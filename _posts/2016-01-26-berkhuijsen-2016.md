This paper looks at the effect of magnetic fields on the polarisation of light from M101, the 'Pinwheel' galaxy. The nature of the polarisation can reveal properties of the magnetic field of the galaxy, which can then be correlated with other properties, such as the spiral structure or areas of star formation, to probe the underlying physics.

The plot shows the spatial distribution of the strength of the polarisation, known as the Faraday rotation measure. The authors note that this map does not correlate with maps of ionised gas in discrete HII regions, suggesting it is emitted by the diffuse ionised gas in M101.
