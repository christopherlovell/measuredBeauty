The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is one of the largest astronomical surveys ever conducted, with photometric observations of ~500 million objects, and spectra for more than 3 million objects. Data is released on a regular schedule for the Astronomical community to use. This paper describes Data Release 7, which was released in 2009.

The plot shows the spectrum of an A-type main sequence star from the survey. The strong broad lines in the spectrum are due to Balmer absorption from Hydrogen. The red dashed spectrum is that available in the previous data release, DR6, while the black solid spectrum is from DR7.
