*Measured Beauty* aims to reveal the beauty of our world through the measurements we make of it.

Plots from scientific research papers are stripped of their borders and annotations to expose their raw data, which can then be appreciated in it's own right; a reflection of our world through the rational human lens.

*Measured Beauty* is curated by Christopher Lovell, a Ph.d. student at the University of Sussex. For further details, please visit my <a href="https://polyphant.com" target="_blank">blog</a>.
