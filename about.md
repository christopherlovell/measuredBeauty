*Measured Beauty* aims to reveal the abstract beauty hidden in scientific research.

Plots from the latest research papers are stripped of their borders and annotations to expose the raw data, which can then be appreciated in its own right; a reflection of our world through the rational human lens, the beauty of our environment revealed through the measurements we make of it.

*Measured Beauty* is curated by <a href="http://polyphant.com" target="blank">Christopher Lovell</a>, a Ph.d. student at the University of Sussex.
