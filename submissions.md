Submissions to *Measured Beauty* are welcome. Please follow these guidelines before getting in touch:

- The original data should be from real world observations. Plots based on simulation data are not currently accepted.
- 'Cleaned' images should, where possible, have no axis, labels or surrounding text.
- Both the original 'cleaned' image as well as the original must be submitted, along with the original caption.
- Submissions including a short (max. 500 words) laymans description of what the plot shows will be prioritised.
- Authors of papers with higher resolution original images available are encouraged to submit these rather than screen grabs from papers.

I reserve editorial discretion.
